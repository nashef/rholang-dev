We're excited to announce the launch of our new community and documentation website for Rholang! This site represents a major upgrade in how we present Rholang to both newcomers and experienced developers.

## What's New

### Community-First Approach
The new site isn't just about documentationâ€”it's a hub for the entire Rholang community. You'll find:
- Project showcases
- Community resources
- Events and meetups
- Contributing guides

### Improved Documentation
We've reorganized our documentation to make it easier to find what you need:
- **Learn**: Getting started guides, tutorials, and examples
- **Reference**: Complete language and API documentation
- **Community**: Ways to get involved and contribute

### Better Navigation
With our new structure, you can quickly jump between learning resources, technical references, and community content.

## What's Coming Next

We have exciting plans for the site:
- Interactive code examples
- Video tutorial integration
- Live REPL embedding
- Community project gallery

## Get Involved

This site is open source and we welcome contributions! Whether you want to:
- Fix a typo
- Write a tutorial
- Share your project
- Improve documentation

Check out our [contributing guide](/community/contribute/) to get started.

## Thank You

A big thank you to all the community members who provided feedback and contributions to make this new site possible. Rholang's strength comes from its community, and this site reflects that collaborative spirit.
